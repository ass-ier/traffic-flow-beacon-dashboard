# TraCI Route Loading Fix - Applied Successfully

## Problem
When clicking the play button on the frontend, SUMO would connect via TraCI but:
- No vehicles would appear on the map
- Simulation time wouldn't advance
- routes.xml file wasn't being loaded properly
- The simulation worked fine when opening AddisAbaba.sumocfg directly in SUMO GUI

## Root Cause
The issue was in `backend/python-bridge/sumo_bridge.py`:
1. The simulation wasn't being stepped after TraCI connection
2. The update loop was only reading data, not advancing simulation time
3. Routes need to be processed through simulation steps to spawn vehicles

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Config Path Selection
- Changed to always use `AddisAbaba.sumocfg` which references `routes.xml`
- Removed reference to non-existent `AddisAbaba_working.sumocfg`

### 2. Added Route Loading Logic
After TraCI connection in `connect_to_sumo()`:
- Added logic to advance simulation up to 100 steps if no vehicles are initially loaded
- This allows SUMO to process the route file and spawn vehicles at their departure times
- Checks every 10 steps for active vehicles

### 3. Fixed Update Loop
Changed `update_data_loop()` to:
- Actually step the simulation using `traci.simulationStep()`
- This advances simulation time and processes vehicle movements
- Updates run at 10Hz (0.1 second sleep between updates)

### 4. Added Proper Command Parameters
Added essential parameters to SUMO command:
- `--delay 0` - No delay for headless mode
- `--begin 0` - Start from time 0
- `--end 10800` - 3 hour simulation as defined in config

## Files Modified
- `backend/python-bridge/sumo_bridge.py` - Main fix applied here

## Files Created
- `test_traci_routes.py` - Test script to verify TraCI works properly
- `TRACI_FIX_APPLIED.md` - This documentation

## How It Works Now

1. **Frontend clicks play button** â†’ Sends request to `/start-sumo`
2. **Python bridge** starts SUMO with TraCI using `AddisAbaba.sumocfg`
3. **TraCI connects** and changes to AddisAbabaSumo directory
4. **Initial vehicle check** - If no vehicles, advances simulation to load routes
5. **Update loop starts** - Steps simulation and updates vehicle data
6. **Frontend receives data** - Shows vehicles moving on the map

## Testing
To test if the fix is working:
```bash
py test_traci_routes.py
```

This will verify:
- TraCI can connect to SUMO
- routes.xml is loaded properly
- Vehicles appear and move in the simulation

## Frontend Usage
The frontend should now work correctly:
1. Click the play button to start simulation
2. Vehicles should appear within a few seconds
3. Simulation time should advance
4. Vehicles should move along their routes

## Important Notes
- The simulation now runs at real-time speed (1 simulation second = 1 real second)
- The update rate is 10Hz for smooth vehicle movement
- All 9,886 vehicles from routes.xml will be loaded over time based on their departure times

## Troubleshooting
If vehicles still don't appear:
1. Check that `AddisAbabaSumo/routes.xml` exists (12MB file)
2. Verify SUMO_HOME is set correctly
3. Check Python bridge logs for errors
4. Run the test script: `py test_traci_routes.py`
