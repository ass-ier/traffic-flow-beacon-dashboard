# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate real-time SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) simulation data into the existing traffic management frontend map. The integration will replace the current mock data with live simulation data from a SUMO traffic simulation server, enabling real-time visualization of traffic conditions, vehicle movements, intersection states, and emergency vehicle operations. The system will follow best practices for real-time data integration, error handling, and performance optimization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a traffic control operator, I want to see real-time vehicle positions and movements from the SUMO simulation on the map, so that I can monitor actual traffic conditions and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SUMO simulation is running THEN the system SHALL display vehicle positions updated in real-time on the map
2. WHEN a vehicle moves in the SUMO simulation THEN the system SHALL update the vehicle's position on the map within 2 seconds
3. WHEN the system receives vehicle data from SUMO THEN it SHALL display vehicle type, speed, and current road segment
4. IF the SUMO connection is lost THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and attempt automatic reconnection
5. WHEN displaying vehicles THEN the system SHALL use different visual markers for different vehicle types (car, bus, truck, motorcycle)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a traffic control operator, I want to see real-time traffic light states and intersection data from SUMO, so that I can understand current signal timing and queue conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SUMO simulation provides intersection data THEN the system SHALL display current traffic light phases for each intersection
2. WHEN traffic light phases change in SUMO THEN the system SHALL update the visual representation within 1 second
3. WHEN displaying intersections THEN the system SHALL show queue lengths, waiting times, and congestion levels
4. IF an intersection has a traffic light override THEN the system SHALL reflect this state visually on the map
5. WHEN an intersection is selected THEN the system SHALL display detailed timing information and phase history

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a traffic control operator, I want to see real-time road congestion and traffic flow data from SUMO, so that I can identify bottlenecks and optimize traffic flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SUMO simulation calculates road congestion THEN the system SHALL display roads with color-coded congestion levels
2. WHEN traffic density changes on a road segment THEN the system SHALL update the visual representation within 3 seconds
3. WHEN displaying road segments THEN the system SHALL show vehicle count, average speed, and flow rate
4. IF a road segment becomes severely congested THEN the system SHALL highlight it with a distinct visual indicator
5. WHEN congestion data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display roads in a neutral state with appropriate indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a traffic control operator, I want to monitor emergency vehicles in the SUMO simulation, so that I can track their progress and coordinate traffic light overrides.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN emergency vehicles are present in SUMO THEN the system SHALL display them with distinct visual markers and priority indicators
2. WHEN an emergency vehicle changes route or status THEN the system SHALL update its display within 1 second
3. WHEN displaying emergency vehicles THEN the system SHALL show vehicle type, priority level, destination, and ETA
4. IF an emergency vehicle requests traffic light priority THEN the system SHALL visually indicate affected intersections
5. WHEN emergency vehicle data is received THEN the system SHALL maintain a log of emergency vehicle activities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the SUMO integration to be reliable and performant, so that the system can handle continuous operation without degrading user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to SUMO THEN the system SHALL establish connection within 5 seconds or display appropriate error messages
2. WHEN processing SUMO data THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth map interactions and UI responsiveness
3. WHEN the data update rate exceeds system capacity THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent throttling to maintain performance
4. IF SUMO data contains errors or inconsistencies THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue operation with valid data
5. WHEN the system runs continuously THEN it SHALL maintain stable memory usage and prevent memory leaks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a traffic control operator, I want to configure SUMO connection settings, so that I can connect to different simulation instances and adjust data refresh rates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing system settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to configure SUMO server host, port, and connection parameters
2. WHEN changing connection settings THEN the system SHALL validate settings and provide immediate feedback
3. WHEN adjusting data refresh rates THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of update intervals for different data types
4. IF connection settings are invalid THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and prevent connection attempts
5. WHEN settings are saved THEN the system SHALL persist configuration and apply changes without requiring application restart

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a traffic control operator, I want historical data visualization capabilities, so that I can analyze traffic patterns and system performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SUMO simulation data is received THEN the system SHALL store key metrics for historical analysis
2. WHEN requesting historical data THEN the system SHALL provide traffic flow, congestion, and incident data for specified time periods
3. WHEN displaying historical data THEN the system SHALL offer timeline controls and data export capabilities
4. IF historical data storage reaches capacity limits THEN the system SHALL implement data retention policies and archival
5. WHEN analyzing historical patterns THEN the system SHALL provide statistical summaries and trend visualizations
