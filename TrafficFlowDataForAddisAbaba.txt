A.4 Intersection Characteristics and Notes
* Oversaturation: Most major intersections operate at LOS F during peak hours, with delays up to 700+ seconds per vehicle.
* Pedestrian Influence: Intersections like Meskel Square and Bole Medhanealem have significant pedestrian volumes, affecting signal timing.
* Bus Stops: Many intersections have bus stops close to intersections, impacting approach saturation flow and queue lengths.
* Geometry: Typical intersections have 3 to 4 legs, with 2-3 lanes per approach; some intersections have dedicated turn lanes.
* Signal Control Types: Most intersections use fixed-time signals, with some locations experimenting with actuated signals.
* Traffic Composition: High percentage of minibuses and trucks compared to developed countries, affecting saturation flow rates and acceleration profiles.
* Non-Motorized Traffic: Minimal but important to include for pedestrian clearance times in signal cycles.
