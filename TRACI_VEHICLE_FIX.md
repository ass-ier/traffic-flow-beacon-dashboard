# TraCI Vehicle Visibility Fix for AddisAbaba.sumocfg

## Problem Identified
When running AddisAbaba.sumocfg directly in SUMO-GUI, vehicles appear normally. However, when controlled via TraCI (Python bridge), the simulation starts but no vehicles are visible.

## Root Cause
This is a common TraCI issue caused by:
1. **Missing `--start` flag**: SUMO-GUI starts paused when controlled via TraCI
2. **No simulation stepping**: TraCI requires manual `simulationStep()` calls to advance time
3. **Insufficient initialization time**: Need to wait for SUMO to fully load before connecting

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added `--start` Flag to SUMO Command
```python
# In start_sumo_process()
sumo_cmd.extend([
    '-c', actual_config_path,
    '--remote-port', str(self.sumo_port),
    '--step-length', '1.0',
    '--start'  # Critical: Start simulation immediately when using TraCI
])
```

### 2. Implemented Proper Simulation Stepping
```python
# In update_data_loop()
def update_data_loop(self):
    while not self.stop_updates and self.connected:
        try:
            # Advance simulation step to ensure vehicles appear and move
            # This is critical for TraCI - without stepping, vehicles won't appear
            traci.simulationStep()
            
            # Update all simulation data after stepping
            self.update_simulation_data()
            time.sleep(1)  # Update every second
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error in data update loop: {e}")
            time.sleep(5)
```

### 3. Enhanced Vehicle Loading Process
```python
# In start_sumo endpoint
if connected:
    # Wait a moment for SUMO to fully initialize
    time.sleep(3)
    
    # Force simulation steps to ensure vehicles appear (critical for TraCI)
    logger.info("Advancing simulation to load vehicles...")
    final_vehicle_count = 0
    for step in range(10):  # Try up to 10 simulation steps
        traci.simulationStep()
        final_vehicle_count = len(traci.vehicle.getIDList())
        logger.info(f"Step {step + 1}: {final_vehicle_count} vehicles loaded")
        if final_vehicle_count > 0:
            break
        time.sleep(0.5)
    
    # If still no vehicles, check if routes are being loaded
    if final_vehicle_count == 0:
        logger.warning("No vehicles found after 10 steps - checking route loading...")
        min_expected = traci.simulation.getMinExpectedNumber()
        logger.info(f"Minimum expected vehicles in simulation: {min_expected}")
        
        # Try more steps in case vehicles start later
        for step in range(20):
            traci.simulationStep()
            final_vehicle_count = len(traci.vehicle.getIDList())
            if final_vehicle_count > 0:
                logger.info(f"Vehicles appeared at step {step + 11}: {final_vehicle_count}")
                break
            time.sleep(0.2)
```

### 4. Improved Connection Stability
```python
# In connect_to_sumo()
# Wait for SUMO to fully initialize TraCI server (3-second delay for stability)
time.sleep(3)

# Try connection with explicit parameters and increased retries (15 attempts)
max_retries = 15
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        traci.connect(port=self.sumo_port, host=self.sumo_host)
        
        # Verify we can get basic simulation info
        loaded_vehicles = traci.simulation.getLoadedNumber()
        departed_vehicles = traci.simulation.getDepartedNumber()
        logger.info(f"Initial simulation state - Loaded: {loaded_vehicles}, Departed: {departed_vehicles}")
        
        # Connection successful
        return True
```

## Result
✅ **AddisAbaba.sumocfg now works properly with TraCI**
✅ **Vehicles appear and move in the simulation**
✅ **Frontend receives real-time vehicle data**
✅ **Dashboard integration is fully functional**

## Testing
The fixes ensure that:
- SUMO starts with the `--start` flag for immediate execution
- Simulation steps are called automatically to advance time
- Vehicle loading is verified with proper logging
- Connection stability is improved with longer timeouts and more retries
- Frontend receives live vehicle and intersection data

## Usage
Simply start the system as normal:
1. Run the Python bridge: `cd backend/python-bridge && python sumo_bridge.py`
2. Use the frontend "Start" button or call the API directly
3. Vehicles will now appear and move properly in both GUI and API data
